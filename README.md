# 🎙️ Justsayit

Justsayit is a speech-to-text app for macOS, essentially a clone of [superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com/). If you're looking for something stable, polished, and feature-rich, be sure to check it out.

Previously, I worked on a similar app using Tauri and Svelte, but I wanted to explore something new and achieve a more native feel. Feel free to check out that project as well here: [justsayit-tauri](https://github.com/sitek94/justsayit-tauri).
