# JustSayIt - Speech-to-Text App Summary

## 🎯 Project Goal
Building **JustSayIt** - a SuperWhisper clone for macOS. Core workflow: Press button → Record → Transcribe → Copy to clipboard → Optionally paste into active app.

## 🏗️ Architecture Achieved

### Clean Service-Oriented Design
We built a modern Swift 6 architecture with proper separation of concerns:

```
SpeechViewModel (UI State - @MainActor @Observable)
    ↓
Individual Services (All Actors)
├── AudioRecorderService (AVAudioRecorder wrapper - Actor)
├── AudioFileService (File management - Actor)  
├── TranscriptionService (STT integration - Actor)
├── OutputService (Clipboard/paste - Actor)
└── AIProcessingService (Text processing - Actor)
```

### Key Architecture Principles Applied
- ✅ **Actors for business logic** - thread-safe by design
- ✅ **@MainActor @Observable for UI** - clean state management  
- ✅ **Enum-based state machine** - impossible invalid states, clear data flow
- ✅ **Direct service integration** - no intermediate orchestrator layer
- ✅ **Implicit Sendable** - no @unchecked Sendable needed
- ✅ **Clean error boundaries** - domain-specific errors at each layer
- ✅ **Real service implementations** - fully functional pipeline

## 📦 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented - Core Application
- **SpeechViewModel**: Complete state machine with real service integration
- **SpeechState enum**: Clean state management (idle → recording → transcribing → processing → outputting → idle)
- **ContentView**: Complete UI with audio visualization and window controls
- **AudioVisualization**: Visual feedback for each pipeline stage
- **State transitions**: Proper async/await integration throughout

### ✅ Fully Implemented - Service Layer
- **AudioRecorderService**: Complete AVAudioRecorder wrapper with permission handling
- **AudioFileService**: Full file management with storage tracking and cleanup
- **TranscriptionService**: **REAL OpenAI Whisper API integration** (not mock)
- **OutputService**: Complete clipboard and auto-paste functionality with accessibility
- **Settings system**: API key management with environment variable fallback

### ✅ Fully Implemented - App Infrastructure  
- **AppSettings**: Environment-based configuration management
- **Window management**: Custom borderless window with drag behavior
- **Auto-updater**: Sparkle integration ready
- **Project structure**: Clean separation with proper Swift 6 patterns

### 📋 Simple/Passthrough Implementation
- **AIProcessingService**: Currently returns input unchanged (placeholder for future AI enhancement)

## 🎨 UI State Machine

**Current State Architecture:**
```swift
enum SpeechState: Equatable {
    case idle
    case recording
    case transcribing
    case processing
    case outputting
    case error(String)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- No impossible state combinations
- Each state provides appropriate visual feedback
- Clear async error handling with retry capability
- Compiler-enforced exhaustive handling

## 🔄 Current Working Pipeline

**What works end-to-end (REAL implementation):**
1. **Start recording** ✅ (state: idle → recording, real audio capture)
2. **Stop recording** ✅ (state: recording → transcribing, save audio file)
3. **Real transcription** ✅ (state: transcribing → processing, OpenAI Whisper API)
4. **Processing** ✅ (state: processing → outputting, currently passthrough)
5. **Output to clipboard** ✅ (state: outputting → idle, real clipboard integration)
6. **Auto-paste** ✅ (with accessibility permissions, real CMD+V simulation)

**UI Features:**
- Single button with contextual text (Start/Stop/Processing...)
- Visual feedback in AudioVisualization (different colors per stage)
- Error state handling with retry capability
- Clean state transitions with proper async handling
- Borderless draggable window with hidden controls

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Enhance AI Processing (Priority 1)
**Expand AIProcessingService beyond passthrough:**
- Text cleanup and formatting
- Smart punctuation addition
- Language detection and correction
- Custom processing rules

### 2. Additional Transcription Providers (Priority 2)
**Add support for mentioned providers in settings:**
- Groq API integration (settings UI already exists)
- Google Gemini integration (settings UI already exists)
- Apple Speech Framework as fallback
- Provider selection logic

### 3. Advanced Features (Priority 3)
**User experience improvements:**
- Recording quality settings
- Audio format options
- Transcription history
- Hotkey/shortcut support
- Minimize to menu bar

### 4. Error Handling Enhancements (Priority 4)
**Better error recovery:**
- Network retry logic
- Graceful API key validation
- Storage cleanup on errors
- User-friendly error messages

### 5. Performance & Polish (Priority 5)
**Production readiness:**
- Background transcription
- Audio compression before upload
- Progress indicators for long transcriptions
- Memory management optimization

## 🔧 API Integration Status

**OpenAI Whisper API:**
- Full implementation with error handling
- Supports multiple audio formats (m4a, mp3, wav, webm)
- Network error handling and retry logic
- API key from environment or settings

**Planned Integrations:**
- Groq (UI ready, implementation needed)
- Google Gemini (UI ready, implementation needed)
- Apple Speech Framework (for offline capability)

## 💡 Key Architecture Achievements
- **No intermediate orchestrator** - ViewModel calls services directly
- **Real async/await throughout** - no callback chains or manual threading
- **Domain-specific error handling** - each service has typed errors
- **Production-ready patterns** - proper permission handling, file management
- **Modern Swift 6** - actors, @Observable, implicit Sendable

## 🎉 Current Status: **Functional MVP**

The app is a working speech-to-text application with:
- Real audio recording with permission handling
- Real OpenAI transcription (not mock)
- Real clipboard integration
- Real auto-paste functionality 
- Clean error handling and retry logic
- Professional UI with state feedback

**Ready for:** Feature enhancements and additional providers rather than core implementation work.

**Next session focus:** Enhance AIProcessingService and add additional transcription providers.
