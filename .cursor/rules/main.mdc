We build a simple app that allows you to record audio and transcribe it to text using Whisper API.

Stack: Swift 6 + SwiftUI for macOS v15+
App is built by solo developer for personal use ONLY (the developer is its only user)
It's MVP, so don't over-complicate it, we don't care about thread safety and performance.

IMPORTANT: Always apply the changes and fixes, NEVER ask for confirmation.
